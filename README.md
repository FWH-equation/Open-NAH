# Open-NAH
Open source code for various nearfield acoustic holography (NAH) algorithms in Fortran (with Python interface)

Please cite the following paper if you use this software:

Chelliah, Kanthasamy, Ganesh Raman, and Ralph T. Muehleisen. "An experimental comparison of various methods of nearfield acoustic holography." Journal of Sound and Vibration 403 (2017): 21-37.

Included nearfield acoustic holography algorithms:

1. Equivalent Sources Model (ESM) based NAH

2. Boundar Element Methods (BEM) based NAH

3. Spatial Fourier Transform based NAH

4. Statistically Optimized Nearfield Acoustic Holography (SONAH)


Example test scripts and sample data will be added soon.
